        <li>This report provides information on unaudited spending by the Province through the end of the 2022-23 fiscal year (March 31, 2023).</li>
        <li>The information in this report is based on the FAO&rsquo;s analysis of transactions recorded in the Province&rsquo;s Integrated Financial Information System (IFIS) as of April 24, 2023. All figures are unaudited, as final audited figures are not available until the release of the Public Accounts of Ontario after the end of the fiscal year.</li>

      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>The Province&rsquo;s yearly spending plan represents the legal spending authority for ministries as granted by the Legislature through the process of supply.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The Province started the 2022-23 fiscal year with a spending plan of $193.0 billion.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></li>

      <h3 class="heading-4">Changes to the 2022-23 Spending Plan</h3>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>The Province may change its spending plan throughout the year, either by requesting additional spending authority from the Legislature or by reallocating spending among different programs through Treasury Board Orders.</li>
        <li>By the end of the fiscal year, March 31, 2023, the Province&rsquo;s spending plan was up $1,294 million, reaching $194.3 billion.</li>
        <li>By sector, the largest spending plan increase during the fiscal year was in <strong>&lsquo;other programs,&rsquo;</strong> at $4,208 million, followed by <strong>justice</strong> ($189 million) and <strong>education</strong> ($128 million). The remaining program sectors experienced spending plan decreases during the 2022-23 fiscal year: <strong>health</strong> (-$312 million), <strong>postsecondary education</strong> (-$116 million) and <strong>children&rsquo;s and social services</strong> (-$65 million).
        <ul>
          <li>The largest program change was a $5,000 million increase for Ministry of Indigenous Affairs, Land Claims and Self-Government Initiatives for the Province&rsquo;s contribution to the proposed $10 billion settlement agreement between the governments of Ontario and Canada and 21 Robinson Huron First Nations over unpaid annuities.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="heading-4">Actual Unaudited Spending vs. Planned Spending</h3>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>Although the Province increased its 2022-23 spending plan by $1,294 million to $194.3 billion, by the end of 2022-23, actual unaudited spending was only $187.1 billion. Overall, this was $7.2 billion (3.7 per cent) less than planned. The $7.2 billion in below-planned spending (or net savings) will be used to reduce both the budget deficit and Ontario&rsquo;s net debt.</li>
        <li>All sectors spent less than planned, led by <strong>&lsquo;other programs&rsquo;</strong> (-$2,407 million, 6.4 per cent), <strong>health</strong> (‑$1,693 million, 2.2 per cent), <strong>interest on debt</strong> (-$452 million, 3.5 per cent), <strong>postsecondary education</strong> (‑$277 million, 4.0 per cent), <strong>children&rsquo;s and social services</strong> (-$275 million, 1.5 per cent), <strong>justice</strong> (-$163 million, 2.7 per cent) and <strong>education</strong> (-$141 million, 0.4 per cent).
        <ul>
          <li>Programs with the largest less-than-planned spending include Treasury Board Secretariat, employee and pension benefits (-$423 million), the COVID-19 Response program (-$341 million), the operation of hospitals (-$279 million), Metrolinx infrastructure projects (-$254 million), drug programs (-$239 million), major hospital infrastructure projects (-$187 million), student financial aid (-$141 million), and municipal transit infrastructure projects (-$117 million).</li>

      <h3 class="heading-4">2022-23 Spending vs. 2021-22 Spending</h3>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>This report also compares 2022-23 actual unaudited spending against 2021-22 actual audited spending to provide context for provincial spending trends and to identify significant year-over-year spending changes.</li>
        <li>Spending in the 2022-23 fiscal year was $6.6 billion (3.7 per cent) higher than in 2021-22.</li>
        <li>The largest year-over-year spending increase was in <strong>education</strong> ($2,496 million, 7.7 per cent), followed by <strong>&lsquo;other programs&rsquo;</strong> ($2,114 million, 6.3 per cent), <strong>children&rsquo;s and social services</strong> ($915 million, 5.3 per cent), <strong>interest on debt</strong> ($789 million, 6.7 per cent), <strong>justice</strong> ($256 million, 4.6 per cent) and <strong>postsecondary education</strong> ($103 million, 1.6 per cent). Conversely, <strong>health</strong> sector spending in 2022-23 was $37 million less than in 2021-22.
        <ul>
          <li>Programs with the largest year-over-year spending increases include negotiated settlements for Indigenous land claims ($5,000 million), child care ($1,213 million), payments to physicians ($1,015 million), operating funding for school boards ($564 million net increase), the operation of long-term care homes ($362 million) and Ontario Works &ndash; Financial Assistance ($324 million).</li>

      <h3 class="heading-4">2022-23 Budget Balance Projection</h3>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>Based on the spending information presented in this report and the FAO&rsquo;s most recent revenue and spending forecasts,<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> the FAO projects a small budget surplus in 2022-23 of $37 million. This is an improvement of $2.2 billion compared to the Province&rsquo;s deficit projection of $2.2 billion in the 2023 Ontario Budget.</li>
        <li>The FAO estimates that 2022-23 total revenue will be $3.3 billion lower and total consolidated expense will be $5.5 billion lower than forecast by the Province in the 2023 budget. The difference between the two forecasts largely reflects more up-to-date information available to the FAO, which includes more recent spending information.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="heading-4">Status of the Contingency Fund</h3>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>The Contingency Fund is used to address spending pressures or fund program changes during the fiscal year. The funds within the Contingency Fund cannot be spent directly by the Province but must be transferred to government programs through Treasury Board Orders.</li>
        <li>The Province started the 2022-23 fiscal year with a total of $4.6 billion in the Contingency Fund. In the second and third quarters, the Province transferred $373 million and $1,302 million, respectively, from the Contingency Fund to various programs. In the fourth quarter, the Province transferred a net $1,064 million from the Contingency Fund to various programs. At year-end, the Contingency Fund had a remaining balance of $1.8 billion which will reduce both the budget deficit and Ontario&rsquo;s net debt.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="heading-2">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>This report provides information on spending by the Government of Ontario (the Province) through the end of the 2022-23 fiscal year (March 31, 2023). The report:</p>
      
      <ul class="margin-10">
        <li>identifies changes made to the Province&rsquo;s 2022-23 spending plan;</li>
        <li>reviews actual unaudited spending in 2022-23 against both the Province&rsquo;s spending plan and actual spending in 2021-22;</li>

        <li>tracks transfers to and from the Province&rsquo;s Contingency Fund.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The information in this report is based on the FAO&rsquo;s analysis of transactions recorded in the Province&rsquo;s Integrated Financial Information System (IFIS) as of April 24, 2023. All figures are unaudited, as final audited figures are not available until the release of the Public Accounts of Ontario up to six months after the end of the fiscal year.</p>
      
      <p>The closing date for spending transactions related to the 2022-23 fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2023, was April 24, 2023. However, there will still be 2022-23 spending transactions that are recorded between April 24, 2023 and when the 2022-23 Public Accounts of Ontario are released. Depending on these transactions, the 2022-23 Public Accounts of Ontario may contain material changes from the information presented in this report.</p>
      
      <h2 class="heading-2">2022-23 Spending Plan</h2>
      
      <p>The Province&rsquo;s yearly spending plan represents the legal spending authority for ministries as granted by the Legislature through the process of supply.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> The Province started the 2022-23 fiscal year with a spending plan of $193.0 billion.<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>
      
      <h3 class="heading-3">Changes to the 2022-23 Spending Plan</h3>
      
      <p>The Province may change its spending plan throughout the year, either by requesting additional spending authority from the Legislature or by reallocating spending among different programs through Treasury Board Orders. By the end of the fiscal year, March 31, 2023, the Province&rsquo;s spending plan was up $1,294 million, from $193.0 billion to $194.3 billion.</p>
      
      <p>By sector, the largest spending plan increase during the fiscal year was in &lsquo;other programs,&rsquo; at $4,208 million, followed by justice ($189 million) and education ($128 million). The remaining program sectors experienced spending plan decreases during the 2022-23 fiscal year: health (-$312 million), postsecondary education (‑$116 million) and children&rsquo;s and social services (-$65 million).</p>
      
      <p>The Province started the 2022-23 fiscal year with a total of $4.6 billion in unallocated funds in the Contingency Fund. After accounting for net transfers to various programs during the year of $2.7 billion, the remaining Contingency Fund balance at the end of 2022-23 was $1.8 billion. The remaining funds in the Contingency Fund will reduce both the budget deficit and Ontario&rsquo;s net debt.</p>

      <p>In 2022-23, all sectors spent less than planned. By sector, lower-than-planned spending was led by &lsquo;other programs&rsquo; (-$2,407 million, 6.4 per cent), health (-$1,693 million, 2.2 per cent), interest on debt (-$452 million, 3.5 per cent), postsecondary education (-$277 million, 4.0 per cent), children&rsquo;s and social services (-$275 million, 1.5 per cent), justice (-$163 million, 2.7 per cent) and education (-$141 million, 0.4 per cent). Also, an unspent $1.8 billion end-of-year balance remained in the Contingency Fund. The $7.2 billion in below-planned spending (or net savings) will be used to reduce both the budget deficit and Ontario&rsquo;s net debt.</p>
      
      <p>For context, the $7.2 billion (3.7 per cent) in net savings for 2022-23 is higher than the net savings recorded in 2021-22 of $4.7 billion (2.5 per cent) but less than the net savings recorded in 2020-21 of $8.6 billion (4.6 per cent). Over the four-year period from 2019-20 to 2022-23, the Province averaged annual savings of $5.9 billion (3.2 per cent).<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">2022-23 Budget Balance Projection</h2>
      
      <p>Based on the spending information presented in this report and the FAO&rsquo;s most recent revenue and spending forecasts,<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> the FAO projects a small budget surplus in 2022-23 of $37 million. In comparison, in the 2023 Ontario Budget,<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> the Province projected a 2022-23 budget deficit of $2.2 billion. The difference between the FAO&rsquo;s surplus projection and the Province&rsquo;s deficit projection is $2.2 billion. The actual 2022-23 budget balance will be released as part of the 2022-23 Public Accounts of Ontario in September 2023.</p>
      
      <p>The FAO estimates that 2022-23 total revenue will be $3.3 billion lower and total consolidated expense will be $5.5 billion lower than forecast by the Province in the 2023 budget. The difference between the two forecasts largely reflects more up-to-date information available to the FAO, which includes more recent spending information.<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></p>
